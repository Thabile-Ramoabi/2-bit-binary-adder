# 2-bit-binary-adder
 2-bit binary adder made using 2 half adders

 INTRODUCTION
A binary Adder is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic sum of two binary numbers provide with any length. A binary Adder is constructed using Full-Adder circuits connected in series, with the output carry from one full-adder connected to the input carry of the next full-adder. In many computers and other kinds of processors, others are used in arithmetic logic units (ALUs). They are also used in other parts of the processor, where they are used to calculate addresses, table indices, increment and decrement operators and similar operations.

INSTALLATION
In order to run this projest, you must have access to DigitalWorks software and Proteus 7. 

    1. For Proteus 7, the inputs are represented using a dip switch and the outputs using the LEDs. Then the half adders are constructed using the XOR gate, AND gate and the OR gate.

        usage
        For proteus we controlled the inputs using a dip switch and on the outputs we connected the LEDs of which the expected outcomes are achieved with the corresponding input bits. The LED outputs are labled S0, S1 and C. The S0 led represents the sum of the input A0 and B0, S1 represents the sum of A1 and B1, while the C represents the carry bit. The LED's will go on when the output is high and off when the output is low.

    2. Now for DigitalWorks simulation, 
        - Open the application.
        - Go to File tab, and select Open (this will take you to File Manager where you will find the "2-bit Adder.dwm" file and open it).
        - Now, to start the simulation, click Run.

        usage
        The inputs are generated using sequence generator, and on the outputs we connected the LEDs of which the expected outcomes are achieved with the corresponding input bits. The LED outputs are labled S0, S1 and C. The S0 LED represents the sum of the input A0 and B0, S1 represents the sum of A1 and B1, while the C represents the carry bit. The LEDs will go on when the output is high and off when the output is low.
